                <p><span class="lead">Being raised in Tampa and Orlando, Florida...</span> I've come to gain valuable knowledge in travel, relationships and perspective. I've lived abroad from 2010 until present in locations such as South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. I've also traveled across several countries within Asia. I also gained a lot of practical knowledge through being an English teacher abroad. Seeing life through a different lens allows you to see and appreciate what's really important in life. My hobbies include street photography, travel, and coding.</p>
